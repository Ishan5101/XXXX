            <h1> FACT 1</h1>
            <div class="p">
                <h5>BIG BANG</h5>
                <p> Its Believed that the universe actually started with a process called big bang. Earlier our whole
                    universe was cofined to a region
                    as small as a point of size of proton. Its a place that physicists call a singularity. Its just a
                    place where space-time does not exist.
                    Then suddenly, it blasted off. But the contraversies about it are that ..think over it where was
                    that proton-sized structure actually placed??</p>

            <div class="p">
                <h5>
                    BLACK HOLES
                </h5>
                <p>Black holes are really very mysterious things. Black holes can be said to be the end of stars. What
                    happens is , a star can be
                    said to be a balance between gravitational force and the nuclear eneergy. This nuclear energy is
                    mainly caused by the hydrogen
                    which is continuously fusing with other hydrogens to form helium. But this process produces a huge
                    amount of energy that balances
                    gravity. Hydrogen fuses to helium , helium to carbon and so on. this is even how all the elements
                    are created. Elements do this
                    to get stability. But as iron is the most stable element, it does not need any process to get
                    stability. Hence when this cycle reaches
                    iron, it stops and then , the gravity is same but there is no nuclear force. So there is no force to
                    balance gravity.</p>

                <h5>
                    Multiverse
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Multiverse is a concept excessively used in science fiction movies. This actually raise a question
                    on the no.
                    universes that actually exists. It says that there are several other universes which are running
                    along with us. But..
                    here comes a question that why do the scientist got an idea about this. The reason lies in quantum
                    mechanics
                    which states that electrons can be at two places at the same time. Another thing is that at the
                    start of the formation
                    of the universe was there in a very very small structure which behaved like an atom.
